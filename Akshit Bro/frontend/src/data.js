    description: `This temple, built in the 11th century by Rudradeva of the Kakatiya dynasty, is a historic temple in Telangana. It stands as a testament to the Kakatiyas'' passion for art and the craftsmanship of Vishwabrahmana sculptors. The temple is called the Thousand Pillar Temple because it was constructed with a total of one thousand pillars, including the Kalyana Mandapam and the main shrine. In this temple, Lord Rudreshwara is enshrined in the form of a lingam on a star-shaped pedestal. The main shrine, facing east, was built with magnificent architecture. In the temple''s front mandapam, facing north, a statue of Nandi, carved from black stone, is installed. The main shrine, situated on a star-shaped mandapam, houses three temples dedicated to Lord Rudreshwara, Vishnu, and Surya, facing east, south, and west respectively, all constructed on a single pedestal with exquisite sculptural art. The sculptures depicting various mythological scenes on the temple''s mandapam captivate visitors. The Kalyana Mandapam, built on a foundation of sand over a water channel and adorned with massive sculptures, reflects the architectural brilliance of the Kakatiyas.
